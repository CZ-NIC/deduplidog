# About

## What are the use cases?
* I have downloaded photos and videos from the cloud. Oh, both Google Photos and Youtube shrink the file and changes the format. Moreover, it have shortened the file name to 47 characters and capitalize the extension. So how should I know that I have them all backed up offline?
* My disk is cluttered with several backups and I'd like to be sure these are all just copies.
* I merge data from multiple sources. Some files in the backup might have the former orignal file modification date that I might wish to restore.

## What is compared?

* The file name.

Works great when the files keep more or less the same name. (Photos downloaded from Google have its stem shortened to 47 chars but that is enough.) Might ignore case sensitivity.

* The file date.

You can impose the same file *mtime*, tolerate few hours (to correct timezone confusion) or ignore the date altogether.

Note: we ignore smaller than a second differences.

* The file size, the image hash or the video frame count.

The file must have the same size. Or take advantage of the media magic under the hood which ignores the file size but compares the image or the video inside. It is great whenever you end up with some files converted to a different format.

* The contents?

You may use `checksum=True` to perform CRC32 check. However for byte-to-byte checking, when the file names might differ or you need to check there is no byte corruption, some other tool might be better way, i.e. [jdupes](https://www.jdupes.com/).

## Why not using standard sync tools like [meld](https://meldmerge.org/)?
These imply the folders have the same structure. Deduplidog is tolerant towards files scattered around.

## Doubts?

The program does not write anything to the disk, unless `execute=True` is set. Feel free to launch it just to inspect the recommended actions. Or set `inspect=True` to output bash commands you may launch after thorough examining.

# Launch

Install with `pip install deduplidog`.

It works as a standalone program with both CLI and TUI interfaces. Just launch the `deduplidog` command.
Moreover, it works best when imported from a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

# Examples

## Duplicated files
Let's take a closer look to a use-case.

```python3
import logging
from deduplidog import Deduplidog

Deduplidog("/home/user/duplicates", "/media/disk/origs", ignore_date=True, rename=True)
```

This command produced the following output:

```
Find files by size, ignoring: date, crc32
Duplicates from the work dir at 'home' would be (if execute were True) renamed (prefixed with ✓).
Number of originals: 38
* /home/user/duplicates/foo.txt
  /media/disk/origs/foo.txt
  🔨home: renamable
  📄media: DATE WARNING + a day 🛟skipped on warning
Affectable: 37/38
Affected size: 56.9 kB
Warnings: 1
```

We found out all the files in the *duplicates* folder seem to be useless but one. It's date is earlier than the original one. The life buoy icon would prevent any action. To suppress this, let's turn on `set_both_to_older_date`. See with full log.

```python3
Deduplidog("/home/user/duplicates", "/media/disk/origs",
   ignore_date=True, rename=True, set_both_to_older_date=True, log_level=logging.INFO)
```

```
Find files by size, ignoring: date, crc32
Duplicates from the work dir at 'home' would be (if execute were True) renamed (prefixed with ✓).
Original file mtime date might be set backwards to the duplicate file.
Number of originals: 38
* /home/user/duplicates/foo.txt
  /media/disk/origs/foo.txt
  🔨home: renamable
  📄media: redatable 2022-04-28 16:58:56 -> 2020-04-26 16:58:00
* /home/user/duplicates/bar.txt
  /media/disk/origs/bar.txt
  🔨home: renamable
* /home/user/duplicates/third.txt
  /media/disk/origs/third.txt
  🔨home: renamable
  ...
Affectable: 38/38
Affected size: 59.9 kB
```

You see, the log is at the most brief, yet transparent form. The files to be affected at the work folder are prepended with the 🔨 icon whereas those affected at the original folder uses 📄 icon. We might add `execute=True` parameter to perform the actions. Or use `inspect=True` to inspect.

```python3
Deduplidog("/home/user/duplicates", "/media/disk/origs",
  ignore_date=True, rename=True, set_both_to_older_date=True, inspect=True)
```

The `inspect=True` just produces the commands we might subsequently use.

```bash
touch -t 1524754680.0 /media/disk/origs/foo.txt
mv -n /home/user/duplicates/foo.txt /home/user/duplicates/✓foo.txt
mv -n /home/user/duplicates/bar.txt /home/user/duplicates/✓bar.txt
mv -n /home/user/duplicates/third.txt /home/user/duplicates/✓third.txt
```

## Names shuffled

You face a directory that might contain some images twice. Let's analyze. We turn on `media_magic` so that we find the scaled down images. We `ignore_name` because the scaled images might have been renamed. We `skip_bigger` files as we examine the only folder and every file pair would be matched twice. That way, we declare the original image is the bigger one. And we set `log_level` verbosity so that we get a list of the affected files.

```
$ deduplidog --work-dir ~/shuffled/ --media-magic --ignore-name --skip-bigger --log-level=20
Only files with media suffixes are taken into consideration. Nor the size nor the date is compared. Nor the name!
Duplicates from the work dir at 'shuffled' (only if smaller than the pair file) would be (if execute were True) left intact (because no action is selected).

Number of originals: 9
Caching image hashes: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 9/9 [00:00<00:00, 16.63it/s]
Caching working files: 9it [00:00, 62497.91it/s]
* /home/user/shuffled/IMG_20230802_shrink.jpg
  /home/user/shuffled/IMG_20230802.jpg
Affectable: 1/9
Affected size: 636.4 kB
```

We see there si a single duplicated file whose name is `IMG_20230802_shrink.jpg`.

## Parameters

Import the `Deduplidog` class and change its parameters.

```python3
from deduplidog import Deduplidog
```

Or change these parameter from CLI or TUI, by launching `deduplidog`.

Find the duplicates. Normally, the file must have the same size, date and name. (Name might be just similar if parameters like strip_end_counter are set.) If `media_magic=True`, media files receive different rules: Neither the size nor the date are compared. See its help.

| parameter | type | default | description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| work_dir | str \| Path | - | Folder of the files suspectible to be duplicates. |

| **Actions** |
| execute | bool | False | If False, nothing happens, just a safe run is performed. |
| inspect | bool | False | Print bash commands that correspond to the actions that would have been executed if execute were True.<br>    You can check and run them yourself. |

| set_both_to_older_date | bool | False | If `execute=True`, `media_magic=True` or (media_magic=False and `ignore_date=True`), both files are set to the older date. Ex: work file get's the original file's date or vice versa. |
| treat_bigger_as_original | bool | False | If `execute=True` and `rename=True` and `media_magic=True`, the original file might be affected (by renaming) if smaller than the work file. |
| skip_bigger | bool | False | If `media_magic=True`, all writing actions, such as `rename`, `replace_with_original`, `set_both_to_older_date` and `treat_bigger_as_original` are executed only if the affectable file is smaller (or the same size) than the other. |
| skip_empty | bool | False | Skip files with zero size. |
| neglect_warning | bool | False | By default, when a file with bigger size or older date should be affected, just warning is generated. Turn this to suppress it.|
| **Matching** |

## Utils
In the `deduplidog.utils` packages, you'll find a several handsome tools to help you. You will find parameters by using you IDE hints.

### `images`
*`urls: Iterable[str | Path]`* Display a ribbon of images.

### `print_video_thumbs`
*`src: str | Path`* Displays thumbnails for a video.

### `print_videos_thumbs`
*`dir_: Path`* To quickly understand the content of each video, output the duration and the first few frames.

### `get_frame_count`
*`filename: str|Path`* Uses cv2 to determine the video frame count. Method is cached.

### `search_for_media_wizzard`
*`cwd: str`* Repeatedly prompt and search for files with similar names somewhere in the specified path. Display all such files as images and video previews.

### `are_contained`
*`work_dir: str, original_dir: str, sec_range: int = 60`*  You got two dirs with files having different naming system (427.JPG vs DSC_1344)
        which you suspect to contain the same set. The same files in the dirs seem to have the same timestamp.
        The same timestamp means +/- sec_range (ex: 1 minute).
        Loop all files from work_dir and display corresponding files having the same timestamp.
        or warn that no original exists.

### `remove_prefix_in_workdir`
*`work_dir: str`* Removes the prefix ✓ recursively from all the files. The prefix might have been previously given by the deduplidog.


### `mark_symlink_by_target`
*`suspicious_directory: str | Path, starting_path: str`* If the file is a symlink, pointing to this path, rename it with an arrow.

```
:param suspicious_directory: Ex: /media/user/disk/Takeout/Photos/
:param starting_path: Ex: /media/user/disk
```

### `mark_symlink_only_dirs`
*`dir_: str | Path`* If the directory is full of only symlinks or empty, rename it to an arrow.

### `mtime_files_in_dir_according_to_json`
*`dir_: str | Path, json_dir: str | Path`*  Google Photos returns JSON with the photo modification time. Sets the photos from the dir_ to the dates fetched from the directory with  these JSONs.
